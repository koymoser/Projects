# Baseball Stats Correlation Matrix Heatmap
Shows the correlation between a number of statistics, which can be useful to see the relationship between each one. 

## Description
I started this project with an interest in investigating how statistics relate to each other, as well as to find the differences that each had on one another. This was all done in RStudio (I used the Posit Cloud version), and the ggplot 2 package was used for the correlation matrix visualization. 
The data in the .csv uses all qualified hitters from 2021-2023 pulled from FanGraphs, giving us three years of data to work with.
